# SQL-project-Industry-level-project-India-General-Election-Result-Analysis-2024

Overview: Analysed the results of the India general elections 2024 using Excel and Microsoft sequel server. The project involved generating insights on seat distribution, alliances performance, and candidate details at both state and national levels.

key highlights:
1. total seat count and statewise distribution
2. seats won by major alliances(NDA,I.N.D.I.A, and others)
3. party-wise and candidate-wise performance analysis 
4. voting patterns across EVM and postal votes
5. identified winners and runners-up for all constituences
